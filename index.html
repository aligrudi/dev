<h1>LITCAVE</h1>
<p>
Most of the programs listed in this page were written to
address my own concerns and for my own amusement.
Nonetheless, I wish others find them of service or interesting.
The most popular of these programs are probably
<a href="neatroff.pdf">Neatroff</a>, <a href="neatcc.pdf">Neatcc</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatvi">Neatvi</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/fbpdf">Fbpdf</a>.

<p>
<b>RECENT CHANGES AND COMMENTS</b>

<ul>
<li>Jun 2024: <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatvi">Neatvi</a>'s new features:
normal mode quick access, extended registers, ex command history, and
rs and rx commands for ex scripts.
</li>
<li>May 2023: Tag commands like :tag, :tnext, :tprev, :pop has been added to
<a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatvi">Neatvi</a>.
</li>
<li>May 2023: <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatvi">Neatvi</a> now supports gf normal mode
command to edit the file whose path is under the cursor.  Now one can
execute "git ls-files >ls" and then "vi ls" to use Neatvi as a file explorer.
</li>
<li>Apr 2023: <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatmail">Neatmail</a> commands now
support multi-mbox mailboxes (a main mbox and many archival or pruned mboxes).
</li>
<li>Feb 2023: Uwe Klatt has added VNC password authentication and touchscreen
support in his Fbvnc fork (<a href="https://github.com/uklatt/fbvnc">link</a>).
</li>
<li>Aug 2022: <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/fbpad">Fbpad</a> has a new command m-;.
It executes a shell for the current terminal, but unlike m-c, sends SIGUSR1
when switching to another terminal and sends SIGUSR2 when switching back.
These signals are used in Fbvnc and Fbff to disable drawing when their
terminal is not visible.  For these to work, the shell must ignore these
signals.
</li>
<li>Nov 2021: <a href="./fbpad.mkv">A demo</a> of <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/fbpad">Fbpad</a>
tag splitting and switching.
</li>
<li>Oct 2021: <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/fbpad">Fbpad</a> can now show the terminals
of each tag side-by-side with the new split command.  Also, it defines the FBDEV
environment variable to specify the drawing region of each terminal; fbpdf,
fbvnc, and fbff read this variable.
</li>
<li>Oct 2021: I consider <a href="https://terminal-wg.pages.freedesktop.org/bidi/">this</a>
proposal for BiDi text in terminal emulators a huge mistake.  Rendering text is not
what the terminal should do, and making that the default behaviour is simply
a short-sighted decision.  A terminal is not a typesetter, and trying to define
paragraphs in its output, for instance, is absurd.
I hope no other terminal emulator adopts it.
</li>
<li>Dec 2020: Kyryl Melekhin has implemented many interesting features in
his Neatvi fork (<a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/neatvi">link</a>).
</li>
<li>Mar 2020: <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatpost">Neatpost</a> now supports Unicode
bookmarks and document information fields (see -mpost at neatroff_make/tmac/tmac.post).
</li>
<li>Mar 2020: Merged David Steinberg's framebuffer rotation patch to the rotation branch
of <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/fbpad">fbpad</a>.
</li>
<li>Jun 2019: Gregory Haerr has ported fbpdf and fbff to Microwindows
(<a href="https://github.com/ghaerr/fbpdf">ported fbpdf</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ghaerr/fbff">fbff</a>).
</li>
<li>Apr 2018: An experimental Neatroff PDF post-processor is included
in <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatpost">Neatpost</a>.
</li>
<li>Mar 2018: <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatroff">Neatroff</a>
now supports .shift, .lsm, and \$^.
</li>
<li>Nov 2017: I have merged the dir branch of <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatroff">Neatroff</a>
into the master after more than four years.  Please report possible regressions.

<li>Jun 2017: Uploaded <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/dblp">dblp</a>
to convert dblp.org search results to refer records.
</li>
<li>May 2017: Neatroff supports blank line macro request (.blm).
</li>
<li>Mar 2017: Added -c option to Neateqn to specify at which characters equations

in minmad.
</li>
<li>Mar 2015: Neateqn can now break long equations after binary and
relational symbols.
</li>
<li>Jan 2015: <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatroff_make">Neatroff_make</a> now
includes manual pages for neatroff and its helper programs (contributed

</li>
<li>Jan 2015: Uploaded <a href="./neatstart.pdf">Getting Started with Neatroff</a>.
</li>
<li>Dec 2014: Uploaded a <a href="./neateqn.pdf">Neateqn Introduction</a>.
</li>
<li>Oct 2014: To make setting up Neatroff easier, I have
uploaded <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatroff_make">neatroff_make</a>,
which contains a top-level makefile to obtain, build, and install
Neatroff and its pre- and post-processors.  Carsten Kunze
suggested it originally and helped to port it to common Unix environments.
</li>
<li>Sep 2014: Many of the incompatibilities of Neatroff are
fixed; most of the credit goes to
Carsten Kunze and Dirk-Wilhelm Peters for finding them.
</li>
<li>Apr 2014: Now Neateqn uses Computer Modern glyphs for brackets
and radicals if they are available (see Neateqn's README).
</li>
<li>Feb 2014: Uploaded version 0.9 of ft2tf, which allows specifying
distinct horizontal and vertical DPIs.
</li>
<li>Nov 2013: A new program has been added to tdq to import Arpabet
pronunciations after converting them to IPA.
</li>
<li>Sep 2013: After about two years, I have merged fbpad's 256 colour
palette.  Now the bold
branch is almost identical to the master branch and is removed.
</li>
<li>Aug 2013: When a program is specified via command line
arguments, fbpad starts the given program, disables terminal
switching commands, and exits when the program finishes.
I have also merged the scrolling history patch from the bold
branch and uploaded version 0.8 of ft2tf, which supports
full-width characters and emboldening fonts.
</li>
<li>Apr 2013: A command was added to fbpdf to override
page numbers; useful especially for documents that start with
roman-numbered pages.
</li>
<li>Mar 2013: I included Jörg Reinhard's patch to support mousewheel
in fbvnc.  I also included a patch to move the viewing
screen for large VNC framebuffers.
</li>
<li>Feb 2013: I added fbvis to view images on the framebuffer.
</li>
<li>Feb 2013: When paused, minmad and fbff now close the OSS device
to permit other programs to open it.
</li>
<li>Feb 2013: Fullwidth characters are now handled correctly in
fbpad; Felix Janda tested the changes and prepared a preliminary patch.
</li>
<li>Jan 2013: Many of my framebuffer programs define a FB_VAL() macro
as an alias for fb_val() function.
The macro can be redefined for speed (should help especially
fbpdf, fbvis and cnoor).  On 32-bit RGB framebuffers, for instance,
it can be redefined as "(((r) << 16) | ((g) << 8) | (b))".
</li>
</ul>
<!--
<ul>
<li>Sep 2015: Uploaded a new version of <a href="./pdftxt-0.5.tar.gz">pdftxt</a>
to work with mupdf-1.7a (patch contributed by Laura Michaels).
</li>
<li>Jul 2016: Neatcc now uses a new register allocation algorithm.
</li>
<li>Feb 2015: The bifont branch of fbpad (which supports switching between
two sets of fonts) implements a new tag summary.
</li>
<li>Jan 2015: Uploaded new versions of <a href="minmix-0.3.tar.gz">minmix</a> and
<a href="./pdftxt-0.4.tar.gz">pdftxt</a>.
</li>
<li>Dec 2014: Two new commands are added to neateqn to adjust the default
brackets or define new ones (bracketsizes and bracketpieces).
These commands specify glyphs for different sizes of brackets and
glyphs for building brackets.
</li>
<li>Nov 2014: The new .eos request of neatroff can override sentence ending
characters (.?! by default) and characters ignored after them ('")]* by default).
</li>
<li>Oct 2014: A new request is added to specify the minimum
line length of the last lines of paragraphs (.pmll) and the meaning
of the argument of .hycost request for specifying hyphenation
cost is changed.  For
more information, read the <a href="./neatroff.pdf">neatroff introduction</a>.
</li>
<li>Aug 2014: Neatroff now supports advanced font features
available in modern fonts; the .ff request enables or disables
features of a font (for instance, .ff FN +f1 -f2 to enable feature
f1 and disable feature f2 of font FN).
Also neatmkfn has been extended to read TTF fonts directly; this
was necessary for extracting information about font features for
neatroff (OTF files should be converted to TTF first).
</li>
<li>Jul 2014: Neatroff through neatpost supports \X'rotate deg' for
rotating the current page and \X'eps file [width [height]]' for
including EPS files.  Also -meps has been added to neatroff's
data package, defining the EPS macro for including EPS files.
</li>
<li>Jul 2014: Neatroff now supports utf-8 hyphenation
patterns (.hpf, .hpfa, and .hcode requests).
Also mktrfn was renamed to neatmkfn.
</li>
<li>Jun 2014: Neatroff supports conditional interpolation with
\?'cond@expr1@expr2@' escape sequence.  More information
is included in <a href="./neatroff.pdf">neatroff introduction</a>.
</li>
<li>May 2014: Neatroff can now format whole paragraphs at once to
obtain paragraphs with more uniform spacing.  Also now it is
possible to specify the hyphenation penalty (.hycost), the amount of
sentence space (the second argument of .ss),
and the amount by which spaces in a line may
be shrunk while filling (.ssh).
</li>
<li>Jun 2014: Uploaded version 0.3 of
<a href="./neatroff_dat-0.3.tar.gz">neatroff data package</a>.
</li>
<li>Apr 2014: Added a <a href="./neatcc.sh">script</a> to fetch, compile, and
set up neatcc, neatld, and neatlibc.
</li>
<li>Apr 2014: Uploaded version 0.4 of <a href="./mktrfn-0.4.tar.gz">mktrfn</a>.
</li>
<li>Apr 2014: I have renamed my small refer clone to
<a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatrefer">neatrefer</a>.
</li>
<li>Mar 2014: Neateqn seems stable now.  Updated
<a href="./neatroff.sh">neatroff build script</a> to fetch and compile neateqn too.
</li>
<li>Mar 2014: Neatroff now reports the bounding box of \w
argument via bbllx, bblly, bburx, and bbury number registers
(added while working on neateqn).
</li>
<li>Jan 2014: Added a <a href="./neatroff.sh">script</a> to fetch, compile,
and set up neatroff and neatpost.  Read its comments
for more information.
</li>
<li>Jan 2014: Added a new command to fbpdf to set the default zoom
level.  Also, fbdjvu now supports rotation.
</li>
<li>Nov 2013: I have revised neatroff's font description format.
While remaining backward compatible with the original troff,
neatroff now supports lines starting with the token "char"
to define characters and lines starting with "kern" to define
kerning pairs; mktrfn has also been updated to use the new
syntax.
</li>
<li>Nov 2013: I have updated mktrfn program to create separate troff
fonts for the specified OpenType font features for neatroff.
Also the new .fmap request (.fmap fontname char_name glyph_name)
can be used the change the glyph mapped to a character or define
a new mapping.
</li>
<li>Oct 2013: Added .char, .chop, and .fspecial requests to neatroff.
</li>
<li>Sep 2013: The mktrfn program now includes a script to create
an output device for neatroff.
</li>
<li>Jul 2013: Now I use neatroff and neatpost for typesetting.
</li>
<li>May 2013: Improved fbvis' fit to page width and height.
</li>
<li>Aug 2013: My Arabic/Farsi letter shaping preprocessor now
handles Arabic diacritics; see <a href="./dir.html">here</a>.
</li>
<li>Apr 2013: After merging neatcc architectures by the end
of 2011, I have been using neatcc daily, and surprisingly,
I have not yet encountered a runtime bug in neatcc since then.
Note that neatcc is, partly intentionally to keep the parser
neater, very lax about compilation errors but for valid
C code, I am inclined to think that neatcc is very stable.
I am no longer dismayed at the sad route GCC is taking.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>TYPESETTING</h2>
<p>
For a guide to set up Neatroff, see <a href="neatstart.pdf">getting started with Neatroff</a>.
For the list of features and new requests,
see <a href="neatroff.pdf">Neatroff introduction</a>.

<ul>
<li>A new Troff implementation <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatroff">Neatroff</a>
and its PostScript/PDF post-processor <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatpost">Neatpost</a>;
Neatroff supports utf-8 encoding, named environments,
long register and macro names,
advanced font features present in OpenType fonts,
paragraph-at-once line formatting, and bidirectional text rendering.
<a href="./neatfarsi.pdf">Here</a>'s a short introduction and
<a href="./neatfbeg.pdf">here</a>'s a brief
guide for getting started, both in Farsi.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neateqn">Neateqn</a> is
an eqn preprocessor for Neatroff, which addresses some of
the shortcomings and problems of the original eqn.  It implements
most of the extensions introduced by Groff's eqn.
Here is a brief <a href="./neateqn.pdf">Neateqn introduction</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatrefer">Neatrefer</a> is a small and slightly
incompatible refer clone.  Also <a href="bib2ref-0.1.tar.gz">bib2ref</a> converts
bibtex files to refer databases and <a href="ref2bib-0.1.tar.gz">ref2bib</a> does the reverse.
</li>
<li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/troff.git">Here</a>'s the port of Plan 9 Troff (troff, tr2ps,
eqn, tbl, pic, and grap) to Linux.
The preprocessors and the macro packages can be used with Neatroff also.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatmkfn">Neatmkfn</a> can create Neatroff
font descriptions from AFM, TTF, and OTF files.
It extracts the details of advanced font features

<h2>PROGRAMMING</h2>
<p>
Many of the programs in this page can be compiled with Neatcc.
<!--
(using <a href="neatcc.c">neatcc.c</a> wrapper for neatcc, neatlibc, and neatld)
or with neatcc and musllibc/dietlibc.
This <a href="./neatcc.sh">script</a> fetches, compiles, and sets up
neatcc, neatld, and neatlibc.
-->

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatcc">Neatcc</a> is a small ARM/X86(_64) C compiler;
<a href="./neatcc.pdf">here</a>'s a brief introduction, which also describes how to set up Neatcc.

</li>
<li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/neatas.git">Neatas</a> is an ARM assembler; note
that Neatcc does not need an assembler, as it generates machine code directly.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatlibc">Neatlibc</a> is a very small ARM/X86(_64) libc
written mainly to bootstrap neat*; I wish to find the time to clean it up
and implement its missing functions.
